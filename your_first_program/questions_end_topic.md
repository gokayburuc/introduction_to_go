## QUESTION : WHAT IS WHITESPACE?

Newlines, spaces and tabs are known as white-
space (because you can't see them).Go mostly doesn't
care about whitespace, we use it to make programs
easier to read.

## QUESTION : WHAT IS COMMENT? 

The line that starts with `//` is known as a comment.



## QUESTION : WHAT IS DOUBLE QUOTE AND HOW TO USE IT? 

The use of double quotes like this is known as a “string
literal” which is a type of “expression”.

In Go strings
represent a sequence of characters (letters, numbers,
symbols, …) of a definite length
